[What is React]
A Javascript library
The purpose of React is to show content (HTML) to users
and handle user interaction.


[JSX]
A special dialect of Javascript that allows us to tell
a React component how it should look when it's rendered
and shows up on the browser.
It looks like HTML but can be placed in Javascript code.


[React vs. ReactDOM]
React is split into two libraries
React knows what a component is and how to make components
work together. (like a definition)
ReactDOM knows how to take a component and make it show up
in the DOM (like a visualisation)


[Installing Node JS]
Check version to check if it is installed if you're not sure
node -v
nodejs.org/en/download
After installing, check node -v again.
(if it doesn't work try restarting terminal)


[How to create a new React project]
npx create-react-app myapp

However, if you have an old version of Node JS, then do the following:
npm install -g create-react-app
(npm seems like it's similar to pip in Python)
(-g is an argument to globally install the package so it can be
accessed from any directory)
create-react-app myapp


[Javasript versions]
ES5 (Support accross all browsers)
ES2015 (Almost completely supported)
ES2016~ES2019 (Poor support)
(But newer versions have newer features for devs, so there is a
tradeoff)


[Babel]
create-react-app installs many packages by default, including Babel.
Translates ES2015~ES2019 Code to ES5 code.


[Import statements]
Javascript has similar import statement syntax to Python.
(ie. import React from 'react';)

import vs. require
import syntax is part of ES2015
(ie. import React from 'react';)
require syntax is part of CommonJS
(ie. const React = require('react'))


[Starting and stopping a React app]
